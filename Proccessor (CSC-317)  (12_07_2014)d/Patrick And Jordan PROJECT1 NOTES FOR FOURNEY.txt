Phase#2 Notes:
-LBI and LDRI Have Been Implemented But Not Tested
-All other instructions have been validated using 

Project Arithmetic Validation:
1.)  Open "*\CSC317-Project1-Phase#2\ProcessorProjectCSC317\Project 1 V Files\MasterVerilog And MIF PROJECT\MasterVerilog_FPGA.qpf"

2.a) Using "InstructionTestSet(11062014).mif"
2.b) View the outputs of the processor at each stage, for each instruction:
	USING the case statement in display mux, controlled by switches[4:0],  and peek into the register file using the additonal switches[17:13]
	("*\CSC317-Project1-Phase#2\ProcessorProjectCSC317\Project 1 V Files\Control Unit And ALU And NON DATAPATH VFILES/DisplayMux.v")

2.c) Compare the outputs with the expected outputs detailed in "*\CSC317-Project1-Phase#2\Phase2Validation.xlsx"
